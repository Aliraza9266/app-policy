  <h1>Privacy Policy for SmartParkBook</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>August 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>SmartParkBook (the “App”) is owned and provided by <strong>YOUR_NAME_OR_COMPANY</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Car details</strong>: license/registration number, car type, car company/brand, parking slot assigned, and selected wash services. These are stored locally in the app (UserDefaults) and used to manage parking entries and exits.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: non-identifying analytics events such as feature usage, app errors, or crash information (if you enable analytics). This helps improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Device information</strong>: device model, iOS version, and app version. This is used for debugging and compatibility support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the core parking functionality (track cars, assign slots, record services)</li>
    <li>Improve and secure the App</li>
    <li>Respond to user support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>All primary app data (car details, parking slot assignments, selected services) is stored locally on the user’s device using iOS local storage (UserDefaults / local persistence). We do not transmit or store personal data on our servers unless you explicitly enable a cloud or backup feature (if available).</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, or other functionality. These services may collect usage and device information. We only integrate reputable providers and limit data sent to those services. If you want details about any specific provider, contact us at <a href="mailto:Alirazashaukat92@gamil.com">Alirazashaukat92@gamil.com"</a>.</p>

  <h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may disclose information where required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable measures to protect data stored on device and during transmission for any optional features. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete app data using the app’s delete/clear functionality (if provided) or uninstall the app to remove local data.</li>
    <li>If the app asks for permissions (location, camera, etc.), you can enable/disable them in iOS Settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at: <a href="mailto:Alirazashaukat92@gmail.com">Alirazashaukat92@gamil.com"</a>.</p>
